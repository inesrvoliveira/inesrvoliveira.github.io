        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>The challenge for this year is going to be centered around financial wellbeing, sponsored by Santander Foundation. </p>
        <p>Financial wellbeing is defined as the state in which a person or organization can smoothly manage its current financial obligations and have confidence in its financial future. This includes four elements:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Day-to-day - smooth short-term finances to meet short-term needs</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Resilience - absorb financial shocks</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Goals - reach future goals</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Confidence - feel secure and in control of finances</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Financial wellbeing depends on people and organizations acquiring a set of financial skills and knowledge (also known as financial literacy) that allows an individual to make informed and effective decisions with all their financial resources. This includes the ability to understand and effectively use various financial skills, including personal financial management, budgeting, saving, and investing. Financial literacy is fundamental to promoting equity, reducing inequalities, and leveraging a more just and fairer, and inclusive society that progresses without leaving people behind.</p>
        <p>Our sponsor Santander Foundation is encouraging activities to promote financial well being and is interested in taking advantage of advanced interactive technologies and user-centered design approaches to leverage financial literacy and promote financial wellbeing. They have an extensive portfolio of online content, training programs and interactive tools that need to be adapted to specific target groups taking advantage of new interactive technologies. Additional contents and tools are also available from the national regulatory agencies such as the bank of Portugal and many others worldwide which you can research for inspiration.</p>
